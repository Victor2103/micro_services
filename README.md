# How it works ?

To run the project, you have to install nodejs. Go on their website for further information. 

Once you clone this github repository, make sure you are in the repository motus and run in a terminal : 

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```

Now, you can go into [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/word)/. You can also go into [http://localhost:300](http://localhost:3001/word)0/. Both go into the same adress because we use redirection.
